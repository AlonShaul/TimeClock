# TimeClock â€“ Attendance Management System

TimeClock is a full-stack attendance management system designed to serve employees in Germany. The system displays the current time using an external API and allows regular users to record their check-in and check-out times, while the admin can view, edit, and manage all attendance records.

## Overview

TimeClock is built to mimic a standard attendance clock system with additional admin functionalities. It consists of:

- **User Authentication:** Login with username and password.
- **Attendance Recording:** Regular users can record their check-in and check-out times based on the current time in Germany (fetched from [timeapi.io](https://timeapi.io)).
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admin users can view all attendance records, edit individual records (including updating check-in/check-out times), and delete records if necessary.
- **Duration Calculation:** Each record shows the duration of work (calculated from check-in and check-out times).

## Features

### 1. **Real-Time German Time Display**
   - The system fetches the current time from an external API ([timeapi.io](https://timeapi.io)) to serve employees in Germany.
   - Berlin's date and time are displayed in real time on the dashboard.

### 2. **User Authentication**
   - Users log in with a predefined username and password.
   - Three user roles: **Admin (Manager)**, **Developer**, and **Sales**.

### 3. **Attendance Recording**
   - **Regular Users:** Can record their check-in and check-out times.
   - **Multiple Records:** Every check-in creates a new record; check-out updates the latest record if not already set, otherwise a new record is created.
   - **Duration Calculation:** Each record shows the exact duration (rounded up) between check-in and check-out.

### 4. **Admin Functionality**
   - **View Records:** Admin can see all attendance records.
   - **Edit Records:** Admin can update check-in and check-out times. When editing, the fields are pre-populated with the exact last recorded values.
   - **Delete Records:** Ability to remove an entire attendance record.

### 5. **Additional Enhancements**
   - **Responsive Design:** Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI.
   - **File-Based Data Storage:** Instead of a database, attendance data is managed via a JSON file.
   - **Deployment Ready:** Easily deployable to platforms like GitHub and Netlify.
